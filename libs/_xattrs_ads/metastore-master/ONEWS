Old times                                                    (2007-2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Old times refer to alleged version 1 of metastore, which was never
properly released or tagged.


### v1 - przemoc's unofficial continuation                   (2012-2014)

In 2012 unofficial continuation has been proclaimed, merging existing
debian patches, including debian/ directory and adding new option -
not ignoring .git directories. This version also didn't have any formal
releases, only new entries were added in debian/changelog file.

 * BUGFIX: Storing metadata with extended attribute without value led to
           false error message and trimmed metadata.

 * .git directories aren't ignored if -g / --git option is used.


### v1 - debian package                                      (2010-2012)

In 2010 metastore debian package started containing patches that didn't
get into official metastore repository.


### unreleased v1                                            (2007-2008)

David HÃ¤rdeman wrote core of metastore in May 2007. His last commit was
in June 2008. He never officially released this software in any form
denoting its version number. His git repository (which no longer works)
was the only official way to obtain the source code.
