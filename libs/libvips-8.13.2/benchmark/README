VIPS SMP benchmark
------------------

This is adapted from the system used to generate images for a Print On Demand project at The National Gallery.

Images from a 10k by 10k studio digital camera are colour processed, resized,
cropped and sharpened. 

This thing was originally processing images off a remote server over a 100Mbit/s
network. No attempt was made to make it quick (there was no point): you 
could make it a lot faster very easily. But it still serves as a benchmark which 
has been tested over many years. It is getting to < 1s per run now though!
