Don't forget to check version in:
* Manpage
* usage.html
* index.html (2 places!)
* changes.txt
* jhead.c
* jhead.spec
* command line help (and date!)
* rpmprep

Also uncomment #define MATTIAS!


put the jehad-2.3.tar.gz into /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
put the spec file in /usr/src/redhat/SPECS

from the SPECS directory do:
rpmbuild -ba jhead.spec

The source RPM will be under /usr/src/redhat/SRPPMS
the binary rpm will be under /sur/src/redhat/RPMS/i386
